Notes on the setup of libisabelle
Legend: ~~/ is the root directory of the repository.

(A) This is a clone of https://github.com/larsrh/libisabelle.
  The setup will stay with git for communication with Lars Hupel
  until the test according to ~~/doc/test--isac-Java--isac-kernel.txt works.
  Afterwards respective components will migrate to Mercurial 
  at https://intra.ist.tugraz.at/hg/isac
  
(B) The project is setup as a Scala project in SCala-IDE for Eclipse.
  The setup does not yet compile correctly, but resorts to ~~/sbt in (2):
 (1) libisabelle > Properties > Java Build Path > Source > Add:     
     ~~/examples
     ~~/libisabelle
     ~~/pide-core
     ~~/test
 (2) libisabelle > Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries > Add: 
     ~~/full/target/scala-2.11/libisabelle-full.jar
 (3) IMPORT OF scala libraries STILL DOES NOT WORK, see
     CodeSpec.scala
       import org.specs2.{ScalaCheck, Specification}
       import org.scalacheck._
	   import org.scalacheck.Prop.forAll
     LibisabelleSpec.scala:
       import org.specs2.Specification
       import org.specs2.matcher.Matcher
 ??? WHY ARE THESE LIBRARIS NOT FOUND IN libisabelle-full.jar
 ??? OR WHERE ELSE ARE THESE TO BE FOUND ?
 	     
(C) Compilation is done with these steps:
  $ cd ~~/
  ~~$ export ISABELLE_HOME=/usr/local/Isabelle2014
  ~~$ /usr/local/Isabelle2014/bin/isabelle build -D . -bv
  ~~$ ./sbt full/assembly
  ~~$ java -cp full/target/scala-2.11/libisabelle-full.jar Hello_PIDE
