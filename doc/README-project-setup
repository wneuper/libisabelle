Notes on the setup of libisabelle
Legend: ~~/ is the root directory of the repository.

(A) This is a clone of https://github.com/larsrh/libisabelle.
  The setup will stay with git for communication with Lars Hupel
  until the test according to ~~/doc/test--isac-Java--isac-kernel.txt works.
  Afterwards respective components will migrate to Mercurial 
  at https://intra.ist.tugraz.at/hg/isac
  
(B) The project is setup as a Scala project in SCala-IDE for Eclipse.
  The setup does not yet compile correctly, but resorts to ~~/sbt in (2):
 (1) libisabelle > Properties > Java Build Path > Source > Add:     
     ~~/examples
     ~~/libisabelle
     ~~/pide-core
     ~~/test
 (2) libisabelle > Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries > Add: 
     ~~/full/target/scala-2.11/libisabelle-full.jar
 (3) Copy *.jar required by Scala files from the space created by sbt:
     ~~$ cp ~/.ivy2/cache/org.specs2/specs2-core_2.11/jars/specs2-core_2.11-3.4.jar ./lib/
   IMPORT OF FURTHER scala libraries STILL DOES NOT WORK, see
     CodeSpec.scala
       import org.specs2.{ScalaCheck, Specification}
       import org.scalacheck._
	   import org.scalacheck.Prop.forAll
     LibisabelleSpec.scala:
       import org.specs2.matcher.Matcher
 	     
(C) Compilation is done with these steps:
  $ cd ~~/
 (1)~~$ export ISABELLE_HOME=/usr/local/isabisac
 (2)~~$ /usr/local/isabisac/bin/isabelle build -D . -bv
 (3)~~$ ./sbt full/assembly
 (4)~~$ java -cp full/target/scala-2.11/libisabelle-full.jar Mini_Test

 Notes:
 (2) creates ~~/lib/specs2-core_2.11-3.4.jar
